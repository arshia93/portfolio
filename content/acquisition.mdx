    **Overview**
    
    At [Trym](https://trymcuts.com/), a marketplace for in-home haircuts, we had a solid base of barbers and clients as early adopters. Our next step was to build a go-to-market strategy to generate more demand and meet our ambitious growth goals.
    
    **Objective:**
    
    Bring Trym to the market of 447,000 men in San Francisco.
    
    **Goals:**
    
    - Grow revenue 20% MoM
    - Establish a 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio
    - Increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

    **Research**
    
    The first step involved deep research into our users and product to support our go-to-market strategy.
    
    Key focus areas included:
    
    - **User data:** Understanding where our product fits into users' lives and habits.
    - **Business model:** Aligning our monetization strategy with sustainable growth.
    
    Insights from our alpha and beta users revealed a critical pain point: finding last-minute haircut appointments. Users often turned to us in these moments, pointing us towards performance marketing.
    
    Collaboration with engineering and design teams led to a thorough analysis of:
    
    - **Target Audience:** Identifying common patterns in our user data to find more potential users.
    - **User Testing:** Conducting interviews and reviewing notes to uncover user habits and decision moments.
    - **New vs Returning Behavior:** Using cohort analysis and user interviews to distinguish between repeat and one-time users.
    - **Funnels:** Analyzing product analytics to identify and close gaps in user journeys.
    - **Devices:** Ensuring consistency across different device types and operating systems.
    - **Geography:** Breaking down user data by zip codes to locate our most valuable users.
    - **Time of Day:** Analyzing website visits and booking times for better insights.
    
    **Problems & Solutions**
    
    Post-research, I developed an experiment matrix to hypothesize which variables would yield the highest conversions at the lowest cost.
    
    **Experiments included:**
    
    - **Marketing Channels:** Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter
    - **Messaging:** Premium, Convenience, Scheduling
    - **Pricing:** $59, $79, $99
    - **Pricing Model:** One fee, Fee + tip, Fee + tip + service fee, Fee + commute fee
    - **Landing Page Design:** Modern, Classic, Length
    - **Funnel Length/Flow:** 3 steps, 5 steps, 8 steps
    - **Call to Action:** Book Now, Schedule Now, Find Barbers
    - **Imagery:** Male/Female barber, Home, Office, Hotel, Shave, Haircut, Trim
    - **Marketing Communication:** Drip marketing A/B tests (timing, messaging, content) via email, text, chat
    - **Referral Incentives:** $10, $20, $50, Free services, Group services, Timing
    
    **Iteration & Validation**
    
    I ran 40 experiments to ensure the winning combination was incorporated into our product for sustainable growth, focusing on conversion, activation, and retention.
    
    Each marketing channel was analyzed through multiple variants to determine the cost per acquisition (CAC) per combination. Careful attention was paid to ensure experiments didn’t influence each other, adhering to multivariate testing (MVT) best practices.
    
    After a few months, we identified the winning formula:
    
    - Google Ads targeting specific keywords, ad copy, timing, and demographics
    - Re-marketing for abandoned booking traffic
    - Product messaging focused on “Availability”, not “Quality”
    - Optimal pricing at $79
    - Fee + tip pricing model
    - Modern landing page with six sections: COVID safety, barbers, how it works, reviews, pricing, FAQ
    - 8-step funnel length
    - 'Book Now' CTA
    - Male barber and beard trim imagery
    - Email + SMS drip campaign
    - $50 referral incentive with two referrals post-service
    
    **Outcome**
    
    After 4 months of customer development and experimentation, I identified the winning go-to-market strategy for Trym, achieving:
    
    - $15k MRR in 6 months (20% CMGR)
    - 65% drop in CAC, achieving a 3:1 LTV to CAC ratio
    - Increased ARPU from $98.75 to $256.75
    
    This comprehensive approach, grounded in data and effective collaboration, underscores my ability to drive product growth and achieve business goals.
