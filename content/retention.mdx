    ## Overview
    
    Trym was designed to offer the most convenient way to find a quality barber and receive a haircut, but 90% of users weren’t returning for additional appointments. We had to act quickly to identify the cause of churn.
    
    **Goals:**
    
    - Increase retention by 1.5X
    - Increase barbers’ monthly earnings to $1k/month (avg)
    
    ## Research
    
    I set up meetings with my co-founder, engineers, designers, support reps, and barbers to discuss the problem in detail. We reviewed the barbers’ feedback, NPS scores, and service reviews to get insights from all angles.
    
    **Key Findings:**
    
    - **Barber Feedback:** Users often asked to text barbers directly, indicating a need for better facilitation of the experience.
    - **Survey Data and NPS:** Common concerns included “Better online booking and appointment management” and "I miss my old barber." Our NPS score was 32, but retention was only 10%.
    - **Cohort Analysis:** Shorter intervals between appointments correlated with higher retention rates.
    
    ## Problems & Solutions
    
    Through 200 user interviews, it became evident that the primary user concern was scheduling appointments, with haircut quality as a secondary concern.
    
    **Key Problems and Solutions:**
    
    | Problem | Solution(s) |
    | --- | --- |
    | Scheduling | SaaS: Offer software for barbers to provide alternative booking options directly to their clients, allowing for flexible in-home haircut scheduling. |
    |  | Subscription: Implement recurring appointments based on clients’ ideal frequency and time, such as a bi-weekly Sunday 6pm slot. |
    | Quality | Training: Use feedback from clients who disliked their haircuts to train barbers, focusing on specific skills like fades. |
    |  | Feedback Review: Share client feedback directly with barbers, allowing personal replies and continuous improvement. |
    
    ### Solution Prioritization
    
    To determine which solution to focus on, I used the following formula:
    (Impact x Number of users impacted) / Cost of implementation
    
    **Scores:**
    
    - **Scheduling:**
        - SaaS: (4 * 4) / 4 = 4
        - Subscription: (3 * 3) / 3 = 3
    - **Quality:**
        - Training: (3 * 3) / 5 = 1.8
        - Weekly feedback review: (2 * 2) / 2 = 2
    
    ## Iteration & Validation
    
    We first implemented the SaaS solution, but it didn’t scale as barbers didn’t refer their own clientele. We then pivoted to the subscription model, starting with a beta program for core users who booked haircuts every 1-4 weeks.
    
    **Strategy:**
    
    - **Mission:** Accessible and personalized haircuts.
    - **Company Strategy:** Offer a platform where men can find and book barbers for in-home haircuts.
    - **Product Strategy:** SmartCut, a frequency-based subscription providing a 12% discount on endless haircuts, making rebooking easier for clients and barbers' earnings more predictable.
    
    **Product Roadmap:**
    
    - Beta test SmartCut (Q3-Q4 '20)
    - Launch SmartCut (Q1-Q2 '21)
    - Launch self-service dashboard (Q3-Q4 '21)
    
    **Product Goals:**
    
    - 30% of users subscribe to SmartCut
    - 35% of SmartCut users stay subscribed for 6 months
    - Increase LTV of users from $158 to $414
    - 70% of Trym barbers make $1k+ per month
    
    ## Outcome
    
    Three months into implementing the subscription model, our metrics told an inspiring story:
    
    - Increased retention from 10% to 35%
    - Increased barber income, providing predictable earnings up to $5k/month
    - Increased repeat purchase rate from 1 to 5
    - Increased NPS from 32 to 73
    
    This rewarding journey at Trym reinforced my belief in the power of an empathetic, user-centric approach to product management. It’s a testament to the success that can be achieved through rigorous problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and iterative testing.
