summary: 'How I increase conversions by 6% using a dozen funnel experiments'

---
### **Activation**
    
    **TLDR:** Launched 12 funnel experiments resulting in a 6.1% increase in conversions.
    
    **Role:** Head of Product, Marketing, UX Design
    
    **KPIs:** User Acquisition, User Activation
    
    **Overview**
    
    Trym, a marketplace for in-home haircuts, initially had a 3.15% conversion rate among visitors. However, with thousands of potential customers searching for quality haircuts, our goal was to improve this rate to scale effectively. By optimizing our conversion rate, we aimed to enhance unit economics and reach more users while maintaining a 3:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Additionally, improving the funnel would boost barbers' earnings and help us achieve network effects.
    
    I collaborated with engineers and designers to identify and address the issues in our user funnel, aiming to:
    
    - Boost the conversion rate per user
    - Increase the number of booked appointments
    - Reduce customer acquisition costs
    
    **Research**
    
    Our approach began with a quantitative analysis to pinpoint where users were dropping off. Utilizing product analytics, we identified key drop-off points:
    
    - 73% fell off at our homepage
    - 12% fell off at the date selector
    - 49% fell off at sign-up
    
    With these insights, we conducted qualitative analysis through cross-functional meetings, support ticket analysis, and user interviews. I also interviewed 25 users who had not booked and 25 who had successfully booked, uncovering the following insights:
    
    **Key Findings:**
    
    - **Matching:** Users struggled to close the deal at checkout due to the lack of barber selection options, which we initially omitted for convenience.
    - **Appointment Clarity:** Users were uncertain if barbers would arrive at the selected time, leading to booking hesitations.
    - **How It Works:** Our landing page lacked comprehensive information about the in-home haircut process, confusing new users.
    - **Rebooking:** Returning users found it difficult to rebook with their favorite barber due to poor account interface design.
    
    **Problems and Solutions**
    
    | Problem | Solution(s) |
    | --- | --- |
    | Transparency | Messaging at Checkout: Improved messaging at checkout to inform users they wonâ€™t be charged until the barber accepts their request and what to expect next. This reduced drop-offs at checkout. |
    | Availability vs Date | Flexible Scheduling: Allowed users to share availability windows instead of selecting specific times, improving match success rates. |
    | Improved Landing Page | Redesign: Addressed user concerns by redesigning the landing page to cover finding a barber, receiving the haircut at home, cleanup, and rebooking. |
    | Personalization | Barber-to-Client Messaging: Enabled clients to message barbers directly to discuss their hair, availability, etc. |
    |  | Matching Based on Hairstyle: Introduced a feature to match clients with barbers experienced in their preferred hairstyles, using inputted preferences and pictures. |
    |  | Selection Based on Hairstyle: Implemented a Yelp-like selection allowing clients to pick barbers based on profiles with pictures, descriptions, and reviews. |
    | Rebooking | New Rebooking Mechanism: Added a rebook button across the website, allowing users to rebook with their favorite barber without navigating through menus. |
    |  | Barber Profiles: Allowed direct rebooking through unique barber profiles. |
    
    **Prioritization and Implementation**
    
    I prioritized solutions using the formula: (Impact x Number of Users Impacted) / Cost of Implementation, yielding the following scores (higher number = higher priority):
    
    - **Transparency:**
        - Messaging at Checkout (6)
        - Availability vs Date (6)
        - Improved Landing Page (8)
    - **Personalization:**
        - Barber-to-Client Messaging (2)
        - Barber Matching Based on Hairstyle (4.5)
        - Barber Selection Based on Hairstyle (3)
    - **Rebooking:**
        - New Rebooking Mechanism (8)
        - Barber Profiles (5)
    
    **Iteration & Validation**
    
    To validate these solutions, we built prototypes, conducted user interviews, and ran A/B tests. The results were clear:
    
    **Outcome**
    
    A new booking funnel was designed, built, and launched within 2 months, resulting in:
    
    - Conversion rates increased from 3.15% to 9.16%
    - 600% YoY growth for Trym in 2020
    - 65% reduction in CAC
    
    **Funnel Improvements:**
    
    - 13% increase in homepage click-through rate
    - 4% increase in checkout conversion rate
    
    This structured approach to enhancing user activation highlights my ability to drive meaningful improvements through data-driven decisions and cross-functional collaboration.
